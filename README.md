# Netlify CMS + NextJS + Typescript Starter

Source: https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/nextjs/

Starter Repo: https://github.com/iammary/nextjs-netlifycms-ts-starter

Start development:

```
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- Upgrade to Next.js 12
- Create a mobile version of the services bar (probably just a dropdown)
- Give an indication that the user's services form submission was received and un-display the form

### Services

- Build mobile version of main service selector using a dropdown; consider starting this dropdown when sizing window down to a "medium" size because it starts getting cut off rather early.
