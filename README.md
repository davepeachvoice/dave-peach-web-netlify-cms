## TODO

- Give an indication that the user's services form submission was received and un-display the form
- Fix audio playback on mobile for audio bar at bottom: may have something to do with iOS preventing auto-play even though the playback is not automatic
- Use AVIF/WebP
- font-display: https://web.dev/font-display/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools
