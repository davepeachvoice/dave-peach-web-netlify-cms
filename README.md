Source: https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/nextjs/

Starter Repo: https://github.com/iammary/nextjs-netlifycms-ts-starter

Start development:

```
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- Give an indication that the user's services form submission was received and un-display the form
- Fix audio playback on mobile for audio bar at bottom: may have something to do with iOS preventing auto-play even though the playback is not automatic
- Use AVIF/WebP
- font-display: https://web.dev/font-display/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools

### Services

- Build mobile version of main service selector using a dropdown; consider starting this dropdown when sizing window down to a "medium" size because it starts getting cut off rather early.
